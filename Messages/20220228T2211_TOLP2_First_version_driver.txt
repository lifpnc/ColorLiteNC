 At this moment I'm trying to make the idea of ColorCNC more flexible and expandable to more ColorLight cards. Therefore I started LiteX-CNC based on the contributions.

Trying to:
- configure the card by a JSON file (click-and-program);
- firmware split over multiple files for better readability and expansion with new functions;
- supports all ethernet FPGA cards which are supported by LiteX.

It is still work in progress (only GPIO out is finished at this moment) and not tested as my card is not yet in.

The repository can be found here: github.com/Peter-van-Tol/LiteX-CNC
