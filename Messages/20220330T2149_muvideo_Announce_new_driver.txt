I'm still plagued by periodic disconnection, anyway I'm uploading my files for who
is interested in playing with encoder inputs.
- Board is 5A75B V8.0
- U9 U12 U15 ic's are replaced (or I-O pads shorted, your preference) for the inputs connection
- I've attached the input/output map in an odf file
- I've attached a PyVCP panel for quick testing the connections
- I've replaced encoder design in original file, my encoders are only quadrature AB, no index input
- Didnt test well stepgens, didnt change their implemetation, but there is something fishy about their behavior
- inputs outputs and PWM seem to work ok
- 12 inputs
- 12 outputs
- 3 PWM
- 6 AB encoder inputs
- 6 step generators
- c and h files for the drivers have some edits for encoder interface
The code is probably broken in several ways, not trustable yet.
